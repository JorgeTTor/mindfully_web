 # Project Requirements
 
 - The layout design was meticulously crafted using Figma, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were employed to implement and refine the layout.
 - Implemented soundcloud to host audios and embedded it on our website. 
 - Used Medium to post the articles and a SocialKit Widget to display the articles on the blog section. It would save development time.
 - The Login and the contact features will be developed on the second stage of this project.
 - Adding a functionality to add favorite meditations and create user profile to save blogs and favorite meditations, could be an interesting challenge.
 - The articles and information about Mindfulness were generated on ChatGPT, asking about general concepts about Mindfulness.
 - The guided Meditation script is a result of outputs generated on ChatGPT inspired on other guided meditations and my personal practice in Mindfulness.
 - The color scheme and layout were choosen on a palette that inspires calm and depth, also the imagery used is inspired on Meditation symbolism.

# Conclusion [WIP]
A website project documentation is a crucial document that outlines all aspects of the project from beginning to end. By including all necessary information, team members can have a clear understanding of the project goals, requirements, timeline, and responsibilities. This template can be customized based on the specific needs of the website project.
